#LinearRegression_Implementation-Basic
It is the implementation of linear Regression algorithm on some sample data points.
1. fit method will train the algorithm to learn from data points and finding corresponding values of slope and intercept to get the best fit line.
2. predict method will predict the output based on test data.
3. cost method will evaluate the least sqaured error which is minimum for best fit line.
4. score method will calculate relative squared error to find the accuracy of the algorithm
